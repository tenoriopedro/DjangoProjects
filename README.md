Agenda - This is a program designed to manage users and their contacts. 
Each user can register and create their own contacts, which are private to them.
Only the owner of a contact can update or delete it, 
ensuring data privacy and security.

This is a project where I am developing a blog application. 
The main objective is to enable users to create, edit, and delete blog posts, 
organize posts into categories, and add comments.  
The application is fully containerized with Docker, 
making it easy to set up and deploy
